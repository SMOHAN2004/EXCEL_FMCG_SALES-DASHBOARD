## Project Insight
1. Overall Performance
- Total Sales Value: ₹435,820.44
- Total Profit: ₹99,041.44
- Total Quantity Sold: 4,570 units
- Top Performing Categories (by profit):
- Personal Care and Household Cleaning dominate in both volume and profitability.
- Packaged Foods had high volume but moderate profit margins.
  
- 2. Top Products by Profit
- - Pantene Shampoo led the pack with the highest profit, contributing over ₹9,800 from just 122 units sold—clearly a high-margin item worth prioritizing.
- Surf Excel Detergent followed closely, generating more than ₹7,100 in profit across 179 units, showing strong demand and solid returns.
- Rin Bar delivered ₹6,453 in profit from 73 units, indicating excellent profitability despite lower volume.
- Odonil Room Freshener added nearly ₹5,000 in profit, with consistent sales that suggest it’s a reliable performer.
- Yippee Noodles rounded out the top five, earning close to ₹3,900 in profit from 156 units, combining volume with decent margins.

3. Sales Type & Payment Mode
- Wholesaler Sales contributed the majority of profit (₹16,650.12).
- Cash Payments accounted for 72% of transactions and 74% of profit, indicating strong offline buyer engagement.
  
4. Time-Based Trends
     - Peak Sales Months: March, June, and September showed spikes in both sales and profit.
- Sales Dips: April and July had relatively lower performance—potentially due to seasonal factors or stock issues.
  
5. Frequently Sold Products
  Top 10 by frequency and quantity include:
- Pantene Shampoo, Colgate Toothpaste, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, Yippee Noodles, and Amul Kool Flavored Milk.


## Final Conclusion
The FMCG business is performing well with strong profitability driven by a few high-margin products. Wholesaler channels and cash payments dominate, suggesting a traditional retail-heavy model. However, online sales are steadily growing and should be nurtured further.
To optimize future performance:
- Double down on high-profit SKUs like Pantene, Surf Excel, and Rin.
- Introduce targeted promotions during low-performing months.
- Enhance online visibility for frequently sold products.
- Refine category-level dashboards to monitor seasonal shifts and payment trends.
