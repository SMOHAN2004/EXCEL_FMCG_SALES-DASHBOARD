## Project Insight
1. Overall Performance
- Total Sales Value: ₹435,820.44
- Total Profit: ₹99,041.44
- Total Quantity Sold: 4,570 units
- Pantene Shampoo made the highest profit, followed by Surf Excel and Rin Bar.
- Personal Care and Household Cleaning are the most profitable categories.
- Packaged Foods sell in high volume but have lower profit margins.
- Wholesaler sales bring in the most profit compared to other channels.
- Most customers paid with cash, which made up 72% of all transactions.
- March, June, and September were the best months for sales and profit.
- April and July had lower sales and profit, possibly due to seasonal changes.
- Products like Colgate Toothpaste, Yippee Noodles, and Amul Kool are sold frequently.
- Some products sell in small quantities but still make high profit.
- Online sales are growing slowly and could be improved with better marketing.
- Beverages and Dairy have low profit margins and may need pricing adjustments.

## Final Conclusion
The FMCG business is performing well with strong profitability driven by a few high-margin products. Wholesaler channels and cash payments dominate, suggesting a traditional retail-heavy model. However, online sales are steadily growing and should be nurtured further.
To optimize future performance:
- Double down on high-profit SKUs like Pantene, Surf Excel, and Rin.
- Introduce targeted promotions during low-performing months.
- Enhance online visibility for frequently sold products.
- Refine category-level dashboards to monitor seasonal shifts and payment trends.
